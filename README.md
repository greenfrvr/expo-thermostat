## üì± Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Expo CLI
- iOS Simulator / Android Emulator or physical device

### Setup with Development Client

This app requires a custom development client due to native modules like `react-native-animateable-text` and `lucide-react-native`.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd thermostat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build and install development client**
   
   For iOS:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
   
   For Android:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open in your custom dev client**
   - The app will automatically open in your newly built development client
   - For subsequent runs, just use `npm start` and scan the QR code with your dev client

> **Note**: This app will not work with Expo Go due to native module dependencies. A custom development client is required.
